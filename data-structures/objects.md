## Basics of JavaScript Objects

### Q: What is the difference between an object and a primitive data type in JavaScript?

**A:** An object in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a string (or Symbol) and each value can be any data type, including other objects. Objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.

Primitive data types, on the other hand, are the most basic data types in JavaScript. They include `undefined`, `null`, `boolean`, `number`, `string`, `bigint`, and `symbol`. Primitive values are immutable, meaning they cannot be altered, and they are compared by value.

In summary, objects are mutable and can store multiple values as properties, while primitive data types are immutable and represent a single value.

### Q: How do you create an object in JavaScript? Explain different methods.

**A:** There are several ways to create an object in JavaScript:

1. **Object Literal Notation:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = {
     key1: "value1",
     key2: "value2",
   };
   ```

2. **Using the `Object` Constructor:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = new Object();
   obj.key1 = "value1";
   obj.key2 = "value2";
   ```

3. **Using `Object.create()`:**

   ```javascript
   const proto = {
     key1: "value1",
   };
   const obj = Object.create(proto);
   obj.key2 = "value2";
   ```

4. **Using a Class:**

   ```javascript
   class MyClass {
     constructor(key1, key2) {
       this.key1 = key1;
       this.key2 = key2;
     }
   }
   const obj = new MyClass("value1", "value2");
   ```

5. **Using a Function Constructor:**
   ```javascript
   function MyConstructor(key1, key2) {
     this.key1 = key1;
     this.key2 = key2;
   }
   const obj = new MyConstructor("value1", "value2");
   ```

Each method has its own use cases and can be chosen based on the specific requirements of the code.

---

### Q: What is the purpose of `Object.assign()`? Provide an example.

**A:** `Object.assign()` is used to copy the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the target object.

Example:

```javascript
const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const source = { b: 4, c: 5 };

const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

console.log(returnedTarget); // { a: 1, b: 4, c: 5 }
console.log(target); // { a: 1, b: 4, c: 5 }
```

In this example, the properties from the `source` object are copied to the `target` object. The `b` property in the `target` object is overwritten by the `b` property from the `source` object.

---

### Q: How do you check if a property exists in an object?

**A:** There are several ways to check if a property exists in an object in JavaScript:

1. **Using the `in` Operator:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { key1: "value1" };
   console.log("key1" in obj); // true
   console.log("key2" in obj); // false
   ```

2. **Using the `hasOwnProperty` Method:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { key1: "value1" };
   console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty("key1")); // true
   console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty("key2")); // false
   ```

3. **Using `Object.hasOwn` Method (ES2022):**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { key1: "value1" };
   console.log(Object.hasOwn(obj, "key1")); // true
   console.log(Object.hasOwn(obj, "key2")); // false
   ```

4. **Using Property Access:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { key1: "value1" };
   console.log(obj.key1 !== undefined); // true
   console.log(obj.key2 !== undefined); // false
   ```

Each method has its own use cases. The `in` operator checks both own properties and inherited properties, while `hasOwnProperty` and `Object.hasOwn` check only own properties.

---

### Q: What are the different ways to access object properties?

**A:** There are two main ways to access object properties in JavaScript:

1. **Dot Notation:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" };
   console.log(obj.key1); // "value1"
   console.log(obj.key2); // "value2"
   ```

2. **Bracket Notation:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" };
   console.log(obj["key1"]); // "value1"
   console.log(obj["key2"]); // "value2"
   ```

Dot notation is generally preferred for its simplicity and readability. Bracket notation is useful when the property name is dynamic or not a valid identifier (e.g., contains spaces or special characters).

---

### Q: What is the difference between dot notation and bracket notation in accessing object properties?

**A:** The main differences between dot notation and bracket notation are:

1. **Syntax:**

   - Dot notation uses a dot (`.`) to access properties: `object.property`.
   - Bracket notation uses square brackets (`[]`): `object["property"]`.

2. **Property Names:**

   - Dot notation requires the property name to be a valid identifier (e.g., no spaces or special characters).
   - Bracket notation can use any string as a property name, including variables.

3. **Dynamic Access:**
   - Dot notation cannot be used for dynamic property names.
   - Bracket notation allows dynamic property names.

Examples:

```javascript
const obj = { "key 1": "value1", key2: "value2" };

// Dot notation
console.log(obj.key2); // "value2"

// Bracket notation
console.log(obj["key 1"]); // "value1"
const prop = "key2";
console.log(obj[prop]); // "value2"
```

In summary, dot notation is simpler and more readable, while bracket notation is more flexible and allows for dynamic property access.

---

### Q: How can you loop over an objectâ€™s properties?

**A:** There are several ways to loop over an object's properties in JavaScript:

1. **`for...in` Loop:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" };
   for (let key in obj) {
     if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
       console.log(key, obj[key]);
     }
   }
   ```

   The `for...in` loop iterates over all enumerable properties of an object, including inherited properties. Using `hasOwnProperty` ensures that only the object's own properties are processed.

2. **`Object.keys()` Method:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" };
   Object.keys(obj).forEach((key) => {
     console.log(key, obj[key]);
   });
   ```

   `Object.keys()` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property names. You can then use `forEach` to iterate over the array.

3. **`Object.entries()` Method:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" };
   Object.entries(obj).forEach(([key, value]) => {
     console.log(key, value);
   });
   ```

   `Object.entries()` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property `[key, value]` pairs. You can then use `forEach` to iterate over the array.

4. **`Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` Method:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" };
   Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj).forEach((key) => {
     console.log(key, obj[key]);
   });
   ```

   `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` returns an array of all properties (including non-enumerable properties) found directly in a given object.

Each method has its own use cases and can be chosen based on the specific requirements of the code.

---

### Q: What is the difference between `for...in` and `Object.keys()`?

**A:** The main differences between `for...in` and `Object.keys()` are:

1. **Enumeration of Properties:**

   - `for...in` iterates over all enumerable properties of an object, including inherited properties.
   - `Object.keys()` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property names, excluding inherited properties.

2. **Output Type:**

   - `for...in` directly iterates over the property names.
   - `Object.keys()` returns an array of property names, which can then be iterated over using array methods like `forEach`.

3. **Performance:**
   - `Object.keys()` can be more performant because it only deals with the object's own properties and returns an array that can be efficiently iterated.
   - `for...in` may be slower because it also checks the prototype chain for inherited properties.

Examples:

```javascript
const obj = { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" };

// Using for...in
for (let key in obj) {
  if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    console.log(key, obj[key]);
  }
}

// Using Object.keys()
Object.keys(obj).forEach((key) => {
  console.log(key, obj[key]);
});
```

In summary, `for...in` is useful when you need to iterate over all enumerable properties, including inherited ones, while `Object.keys()` is preferred when you only need the object's own properties.

---

### Q: How do you clone an object in JavaScript?

**A:** There are several ways to clone an object in JavaScript:

1. **Using `Object.assign()` Method:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" };
   const clone = Object.assign({}, obj);
   console.log(clone); // { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" }
   ```

2. **Using Spread Operator (`...`):**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" };
   const clone = { ...obj };
   console.log(clone); // { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" }
   ```

3. **Using `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" };
   const clone = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));
   console.log(clone); // { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" }
   ```

4. **Using `structuredClone()` (ES2021):**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" };
   const clone = structuredClone(obj);
   console.log(clone); // { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" }
   ```

Each method has its own use cases. `Object.assign()` and the spread operator are shallow clones, meaning they only clone the first level of the object. `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` can be used for deep cloning but have limitations with functions and undefined values. `structuredClone()` is a modern method that handles deep cloning more effectively.

---

### Q: What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy in JavaScript objects?

**A:** The main differences between shallow copy and deep copy are:

1. **Shallow Copy:**

   - A shallow copy creates a new object, but only copies the references of nested objects. This means that changes to nested objects in the copied object will affect the original object.
   - Methods like `Object.assign()` and the spread operator (`...`) create shallow copies.

   Example:

   ```javascript
   const original = { key1: "value1", nested: { key2: "value2" } };
   const shallowCopy = { ...original };
   shallowCopy.nested.key2 = "newValue";
   console.log(original.nested.key2); // "newValue"
   ```

2. **Deep Copy:**

   - A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all nested objects. This means that changes to nested objects in the copied object will not affect the original object.
   - Methods like `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` and `structuredClone()` (ES2021) can be used for deep copying.

   Example:

   ```javascript
   const original = { key1: "value1", nested: { key2: "value2" } };
   const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original));
   deepCopy.nested.key2 = "newValue";
   console.log(original.nested.key2); // "value2"
   ```

In summary, a shallow copy only copies the top-level properties, while a deep copy recursively copies all levels of the object.

## Object Prototypes and Inheritance

### Q: What is the prototype chain in JavaScript?

**A:** The prototype chain in JavaScript is a mechanism through which objects inherit properties and methods from other objects. It is a fundamental feature of JavaScript's object-oriented programming.

When you access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks for that property or method on the object itself. If it is not found, JavaScript then looks at the object's prototype, and if it is still not found, it continues to look up the prototype chain until it reaches the top, which is `Object.prototype`.

Every JavaScript object has a prototype, which is another object from which it inherits properties and methods. The prototype of an object can be accessed using the `__proto__` property or the `Object.getPrototypeOf()` method.

Example:

```javascript
const obj = { key1: "value1" };
console.log(obj.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // true
```

In this example, `obj` inherits from `Object.prototype`, which is the top of the prototype chain. If you try to access a property or method that does not exist on `obj`, JavaScript will look for it on `Object.prototype`.

The prototype chain allows for the reuse of properties and methods across multiple objects, enabling a form of inheritance in JavaScript.

---

### Q: How do you create an object without a prototype?

**A:** You can create an object without a prototype using `Object.create(null)`. This creates a plain object that does not inherit from `Object.prototype`.

Example:

```javascript
const obj = Object.create(null);
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)); // null
```

In this example, `obj` is created without a prototype, meaning it does not inherit any properties or methods from `Object.prototype`. This can be useful when you need a truly plain object without any inherited properties.

---

### Q: What is the difference between `Object.create()` and a constructor function?

**A:** The main differences between `Object.create()` and a constructor function are:

1. **Creation of Objects:**

   - `Object.create()` creates a new object with the specified prototype object and properties. It allows you to directly set the prototype of the new object.
   - A constructor function is used with the `new` keyword to create a new object. The prototype of the new object is set to the `prototype` property of the constructor function.

2. **Syntax:**

   - `Object.create()` syntax:
     ```javascript
     const proto = { key1: "value1" };
     const obj = Object.create(proto);
     ```
   - Constructor function syntax:
     ```javascript
     function MyConstructor(key1) {
       this.key1 = key1;
     }
     const obj = new MyConstructor("value1");
     ```

3. **Inheritance:**

   - `Object.create()` allows for more flexible and fine-grained inheritance by directly specifying the prototype object.
   - Constructor functions use the `prototype` property to set up inheritance, which is less flexible compared to `Object.create()`.

4. **Initialization:**
   - `Object.create()` does not automatically call an initialization function. You need to manually set properties on the new object.
   - Constructor functions can include initialization code to set up the new object.

Examples:

Using `Object.create()`:

```javascript
const proto = {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello");
  },
};
const obj = Object.create(proto);
obj.greet(); // "Hello"
```

Using a constructor function:

```javascript
function MyConstructor() {}
MyConstructor.prototype.greet = function () {
  console.log("Hello");
};
const obj = new MyConstructor();
obj.greet(); // "Hello"
```

In summary, `Object.create()` provides more control over the prototype of the new object, while constructor functions are a more traditional way to create objects and set up inheritance in JavaScript.

---

### Q: How can you set or change an objectâ€™s prototype?

**A:** You can set or change an object's prototype using the following methods:

1. **Using `Object.create()` to Set Prototype at Creation:**

   ```javascript
   const proto = {
     greet() {
       console.log("Hello");
     },
   };
   const obj = Object.create(proto);
   console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) === proto); // true
   ```

2. **Using `Object.setPrototypeOf()` to Change Prototype:**

   ```javascript
   const proto = {
     greet() {
       console.log("Hello");
     },
   };
   const obj = {};
   Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, proto);
   console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) === proto); // true
   ```

3. **Using `__proto__` Property (Deprecated):**

   ```javascript
   const proto = {
     greet() {
       console.log("Hello");
     },
   };
   const obj = {};
   obj.__proto__ = proto;
   console.log(obj.__proto__ === proto); // true
   ```

   Note: The `__proto__` property is deprecated and should be avoided in favor of `Object.setPrototypeOf()`.

Each method allows you to set or change the prototype of an object, enabling inheritance and reuse of properties and methods from the prototype object.

---

### Q: What is the purpose of the hasOwnProperty() method?

**A:** The `hasOwnProperty()` method is used to check whether an object has a specific property as its own (not inherited) property. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property.

Example:

```javascript
const obj = { key1: "value1" };
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty("key1")); // true
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty("key2")); // false
```

In this example, `obj.hasOwnProperty("key1")` returns `true` because `key1` is an own property of `obj`. `obj.hasOwnProperty("key2")` returns `false` because `key2` is not an own property of `obj`.

The `hasOwnProperty()` method is useful for distinguishing between own properties and inherited properties, especially when iterating over an object's properties.

---

### Q: What happens if a property is not found on an object?

**A:** If a property is not found on an object, JavaScript will look for the property on the object's prototype. This process continues up the prototype chain until the property is found or the end of the chain is reached (i.e., `Object.prototype`). If the property is not found anywhere in the prototype chain, the result will be `undefined`.

Example:

```javascript
const proto = { key1: "value1" };
const obj = Object.create(proto);

console.log(obj.key1); // "value1" (found on prototype)
console.log(obj.key2); // undefined (not found)
```

In this example, `obj.key1` is found on the prototype, so it returns `"value1"`. However, `obj.key2` is not found on the object or its prototype, so it returns `undefined`.

This behavior allows objects to inherit properties and methods from their prototypes, enabling a form of inheritance in JavaScript.

---

### Q: How do you inherit properties from another object in JavaScript?

**A:** In JavaScript, you can inherit properties from another object using the following methods:

1. **Using `Object.create()` Method:**

   ```javascript
   const parent = { key1: "value1" };
   const child = Object.create(parent);
   console.log(child.key1); // "value1"
   ```

   In this example, `child` inherits properties from `parent`. The `child` object has access to `key1` through the prototype chain.

2. **Using Constructor Functions:**

   ```javascript
   function Parent() {
     this.key1 = "value1";
   }

   function Child() {
     Parent.call(this);
   }

   Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype);
   Child.prototype.constructor = Child;

   const child = new Child();
   console.log(child.key1); // "value1"
   ```

   In this example, `Child` inherits properties from `Parent` using a combination of constructor functions and the prototype chain.

3. **Using ES6 Classes:**

   ```javascript
   class Parent {
     constructor() {
       this.key1 = "value1";
     }
   }

   class Child extends Parent {
     constructor() {
       super();
     }
   }

   const child = new Child();
   console.log(child.key1); // "value1"
   ```

   In this example, `Child` inherits properties from `Parent` using the `extends` keyword and the `super()` function to call the parent class constructor.

Each method allows you to set up inheritance in JavaScript, enabling objects to share properties and methods from a parent object or class.

---

### Q: What is the difference between a constructor function and the class syntax?

**A:** The main differences between a constructor function and the class syntax in JavaScript are:

1. **Syntax:**

   - Constructor functions use the `function` keyword and are invoked with the `new` keyword.
   - Classes use the `class` keyword and have a more concise and readable syntax.

   Example of a constructor function:

   ```javascript
   function Person(name) {
     this.name = name;
   }
   Person.prototype.greet = function () {
     console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
   };
   const person = new Person("Alice");
   person.greet(); // "Hello, my name is Alice"
   ```

   Example of a class:

   ```javascript
   class Person {
     constructor(name) {
       this.name = name;
     }
     greet() {
       console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
     }
   }
   const person = new Person("Alice");
   person.greet(); // "Hello, my name is Alice"
   ```

2. **Inheritance:**

   - Constructor functions use the `prototype` property and `Object.create()` for inheritance.
   - Classes use the `extends` keyword and the `super()` function for inheritance.

   Example of inheritance with constructor functions:

   ```javascript
   function Animal(name) {
     this.name = name;
   }
   Animal.prototype.speak = function () {
     console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise`);
   };

   function Dog(name) {
     Animal.call(this, name);
   }
   Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
   Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;

   const dog = new Dog("Rex");
   dog.speak(); // "Rex makes a noise"
   ```

   Example of inheritance with classes:

   ```javascript
   class Animal {
     constructor(name) {
       this.name = name;
     }
     speak() {
       console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise`);
     }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
     constructor(name) {
       super(name);
     }
   }

   const dog = new Dog("Rex");
   dog.speak(); // "Rex makes a noise"
   ```

3. **Static Methods:**

   - In constructor functions, static methods are added directly to the constructor function.
   - In classes, static methods are defined using the `static` keyword.

   Example of static methods with constructor functions:

   ```javascript
   function Person(name) {
     this.name = name;
   }
   Person.greet = function () {
     console.log("Hello");
   };
   Person.greet(); // "Hello"
   ```

   Example of static methods with classes:

   ```javascript
   class Person {
     constructor(name) {
       this.name = name;
     }
     static greet() {
       console.log("Hello");
     }
   }
   Person.greet(); // "Hello"
   ```

In summary, the class syntax provides a more modern, readable, and concise way to create and manage objects and inheritance in JavaScript, while constructor functions are the traditional way of achieving the same functionality.

---

### Q: What are the differences between `__proto__` and `prototype`?

**A:** The main differences between `__proto__` and `prototype` in JavaScript are:

1. **Definition:**

   - `__proto__` is an internal property of an object that points to its prototype.
   - `prototype` is a property of a constructor function that is used to set the prototype of objects created by that constructor.

2. **Usage:**

   - `__proto__` is used to access or modify the prototype of an existing object.
   - `prototype` is used to define methods and properties that should be inherited by all instances of a constructor function.

3. **Syntax:**
   - `__proto__` is accessed directly on an object instance.
   - `prototype` is accessed on a constructor function.

Examples:

Using `__proto__`:

```javascript
const obj = {};
const proto = {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello");
  },
};
obj.__proto__ = proto;
obj.greet(); // "Hello"
```

Using `prototype`:

```javascript
function MyConstructor() {}
MyConstructor.prototype.greet = function () {
  console.log("Hello");
};
const obj = new MyConstructor();
obj.greet(); // "Hello"
```

4. **Standardization:**
   - `__proto__` is a legacy feature and its use is generally discouraged in favor of `Object.getPrototypeOf()` and `Object.setPrototypeOf()`.
   - `prototype` is a standard part of the constructor function and is widely used for inheritance.

In summary, `__proto__` is an internal property used to access or modify an object's prototype, while `prototype` is a property of a constructor function used to define properties and methods for instances created by that constructor.

---

### Q: How do you override a method in a subclass?

**A:** To override a method in a subclass, you define a method with the same name in the subclass. This method will replace the method inherited from the parent class.

Example using ES6 classes:

```javascript
class Parent {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello from Parent");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello from Child");
  }
}

const child = new Child();
child.greet(); // "Hello from Child"
```

In this example, the `greet` method in the `Child` class overrides the `greet` method in the `Parent` class. When `greet` is called on an instance of `Child`, the overridden method in the `Child` class is executed.

Example using constructor functions:

```javascript
function Parent() {}
Parent.prototype.greet = function () {
  console.log("Hello from Parent");
};

function Child() {}
Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype);
Child.prototype.constructor = Child;
Child.prototype.greet = function () {
  console.log("Hello from Child");
};

const child = new Child();
child.greet(); // "Hello from Child"
```

In this example, the `greet` method in the `Child` prototype overrides the `greet` method in the `Parent` prototype. When `greet` is called on an instance of `Child`, the overridden method in the `Child` prototype is executed.

Overriding methods allows subclasses to provide specific implementations while still inheriting properties and methods from the parent class.

---

## Object Manipulation

### Q: How do you merge two objects in JavaScript?

**A:** You can merge two objects in JavaScript using the following methods:

1. **Using `Object.assign()` Method:**

   ```javascript
   const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
   const obj2 = { b: 3, c: 4 };
   const merged = Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2);
   console.log(merged); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }
   ```

2. **Using Spread Operator (`...`):**

   ```javascript
   const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
   const obj2 = { b: 3, c: 4 };
   const merged = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
   console.log(merged); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }
   ```

Both methods create a new object by copying properties from the source objects. If there are properties with the same name, the value from the last object will overwrite the previous ones.

### Q: What is the difference between `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()`?

**A:** The main differences between `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()` are:

1. **`Object.keys()`**:

   - Returns an array of the object's own enumerable property names (keys).
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
     console.log(Object.keys(obj)); // ["a", "b", "c"]
     ```

2. **`Object.values()`**:

   - Returns an array of the object's own enumerable property values.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
     console.log(Object.values(obj)); // [1, 2, 3]
     ```

3. **`Object.entries()`**:
   - Returns an array of the object's own enumerable property `[key, value]` pairs.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
     console.log(Object.entries(obj)); // [["a", 1], ["b", 2], ["c", 3]]
     ```

In summary, `Object.keys()` returns the property names, `Object.values()` returns the property values, and `Object.entries()` returns both the property names and values as `[key, value]` pairs.

---

### Q: How can you convert an object to an array in JavaScript?

**A:** You can convert an object to an array in JavaScript using the following methods:

1. **Using `Object.keys()` Method:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
   const keysArray = Object.keys(obj);
   console.log(keysArray); // ["a", "b", "c"]
   ```

2. **Using `Object.values()` Method:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
   const valuesArray = Object.values(obj);
   console.log(valuesArray); // [1, 2, 3]
   ```

3. **Using `Object.entries()` Method:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
   const entriesArray = Object.entries(obj);
   console.log(entriesArray); // [["a", 1], ["b", 2], ["c", 3]]
   ```

Each method converts the object into an array in different ways, depending on whether you need the keys, values, or both key-value pairs.

### Q: How do you freeze an object in JavaScript? What does it prevent?

**A:** You can freeze an object in JavaScript using the `Object.freeze()` method. Freezing an object prevents new properties from being added to it, existing properties from being removed, and existing properties from being changed (i.e., it makes the object immutable).

Example:

```javascript
const obj = { key1: "value1" };
Object.freeze(obj);

obj.key1 = "newValue"; // This will not change the value
obj.key2 = "value2"; // This will not add a new property

console.log(obj); // { key1: "value1" }
```

In this example, `Object.freeze(obj)` makes the `obj` object immutable. Any attempts to modify the object will have no effect.

Freezing an object is useful when you want to ensure that the object remains constant and its properties cannot be altered.

---

### Q: What is the purpose of `Object.seal()` and how is it different from `Object.freeze()`?

**A:** The `Object.seal()` method is used to seal an object, preventing new properties from being added to it and marking all existing properties as non-configurable. However, unlike `Object.freeze()`, it does not prevent the modification of existing property values.

Example:

```javascript
const obj = { key1: "value1" };
Object.seal(obj);

obj.key1 = "newValue"; // This will change the value
obj.key2 = "value2"; // This will not add a new property

console.log(obj); // { key1: "newValue" }
```

In this example, `Object.seal(obj)` allows the modification of existing property values but prevents the addition of new properties.

**Differences between `Object.seal()` and `Object.freeze()`:**

1. **Property Addition:**

   - `Object.seal()`: Prevents new properties from being added.
   - `Object.freeze()`: Prevents new properties from being added.

2. **Property Deletion:**

   - `Object.seal()`: Prevents existing properties from being deleted.
   - `Object.freeze()`: Prevents existing properties from being deleted.

3. **Property Modification:**
   - `Object.seal()`: Allows modification of existing property values.
   - `Object.freeze()`: Prevents modification of existing property values.

In summary, `Object.seal()` allows changes to existing property values but prevents adding or removing properties, while `Object.freeze()` makes the object completely immutable.

---

### Q: How do you make a property non-enumerable?

**A:** You can make a property non-enumerable using the `Object.defineProperty()` method. This method allows you to define or modify a property on an object and specify its attributes, including `enumerable`.

Example:

```javascript
const obj = { key1: "value1" };
Object.defineProperty(obj, "key2", {
  value: "value2",
  enumerable: false,
});

console.log(obj.key2); // "value2"
console.log(Object.keys(obj)); // ["key1"]
```

In this example, `key2` is defined as a non-enumerable property. As a result, it does not appear in the array returned by `Object.keys()`, but it can still be accessed directly.

Making a property non-enumerable is useful when you want to hide it from enumeration methods like `for...in` and `Object.keys()`, while still allowing direct access to the property.

---

### Q: How do you delete a property from an object?

**A:** You can delete a property from an object using the `delete` operator. This operator removes the specified property from the object.

Example:

```javascript
const obj = { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" };
delete obj.key1;
console.log(obj); // { key2: "value2" }
```

In this example, the `delete` operator removes the `key1` property from the `obj` object. After the deletion, `obj` only contains the `key2` property.

The `delete` operator is useful when you need to remove properties from an object dynamically.

---

### Q: How do you define getters and setters in an object?

**A:** You can define getters and setters in an object using the `get` and `set` keywords within an object literal or by using `Object.defineProperty()`.

1. **Using Object Literal Syntax:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = {
     _key: "value",
     get key() {
       return this._key;
     },
     set key(value) {
       this._key = value;
     },
   };

   console.log(obj.key); // "value"
   obj.key = "newValue";
   console.log(obj.key); // "newValue"
   ```

2. **Using `Object.defineProperty()`:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { _key: "value" };
   Object.defineProperty(obj, "key", {
     get() {
       return this._key;
     },
     set(value) {
       this._key = value;
     },
   });

   console.log(obj.key); // "value"
   obj.key = "newValue";
   console.log(obj.key); // "newValue"
   ```

In both examples, the getter method allows you to access the property value, and the setter method allows you to modify the property value. The underscore `_` before `key` is a common convention to indicate a private property.

## Object Context and Methods

### Q: What is the `this` keyword in the context of an object?

**A:** The `this` keyword in the context of an object refers to the object itself. It is used to access the properties and methods of the object within its own methods.

Example:

```javascript
const obj = {
  key1: "value1",
  key2: "value2",
  showKeys() {
    console.log(this.key1, this.key2);
  },
};

obj.showKeys(); // "value1 value2"
```

In this example, `this.key1` and `this.key2` refer to the properties `key1` and `key2` of the `obj` object. The `this` keyword allows the `showKeys` method to access and use the object's properties.

The value of `this` is determined by how a function is called. In the context of an object method, `this` refers to the object that the method is called on.

---

### Q: How does the value of `this` change based on how a function is called?

**A:** The value of `this` in JavaScript depends on the context in which a function is called. Here are some common scenarios:

1. **Global Context:**

   - In the global context, `this` refers to the global object (`window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js).

   ```javascript
   console.log(this); // In a browser, this will log the window object
   ```

2. **Object Method:**

   - When a function is called as a method of an object, `this` refers to the object.

   ```javascript
   const obj = {
     key: "value",
     showKey() {
       console.log(this.key);
     },
   };
   obj.showKey(); // "value"
   ```

3. **Constructor Function:**

   - When a function is used as a constructor with the `new` keyword, `this` refers to the newly created instance.

   ```javascript
   function MyConstructor() {
     this.key = "value";
   }
   const instance = new MyConstructor();
   console.log(instance.key); // "value"
   ```

4. **Explicit Binding:**

   - Using `call`, `apply`, or `bind` methods, you can explicitly set the value of `this`.

   ```javascript
   function showKey() {
     console.log(this.key);
   }
   const obj = { key: "value" };
   showKey.call(obj); // "value"
   ```

5. **Arrow Functions:**

   - Arrow functions do not have their own `this` context. Instead, `this` is lexically inherited from the surrounding scope.

   ```javascript
   const obj = {
     key: "value",
     showKey: () => {
       console.log(this.key);
     },
   };
   obj.showKey(); // undefined (inherited from global scope)
   ```

6. **Event Handlers:**
   - In event handlers, `this` refers to the element that received the event.
   ```javascript
   document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function () {
     console.log(this); // The button element
   });
   ```

Understanding how `this` behaves in different contexts is crucial for writing correct and predictable JavaScript code.

---

### Q: What is the purpose of `bind()`, `call()`, and `apply()`? Provide examples.

**A:** The `bind()`, `call()`, and `apply()` methods are used to set the value of `this` in a function and to invoke functions with a specific `this` value and arguments.

1. **`bind()` Method:**

   - The `bind()` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` value set to the provided value. It does not immediately invoke the function.

   Example:

   ```javascript
   const obj = { key: "value" };
   function showKey() {
     console.log(this.key);
   }
   const boundShowKey = showKey.bind(obj);
   boundShowKey(); // "value"
   ```

2. **`call()` Method:**

   - The `call()` method invokes a function with a specified `this` value and arguments provided individually.

   Example:

   ```javascript
   const obj = { key: "value" };
   function showKey(arg1, arg2) {
     console.log(this.key, arg1, arg2);
   }
   showKey.call(obj, "arg1", "arg2"); // "value arg1 arg2"
   ```

3. **`apply()` Method:**

   - The `apply()` method invokes a function with a specified `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

   Example:

   ```javascript
   const obj = { key: "value" };
   function showKey(arg1, arg2) {
     console.log(this.key, arg1, arg2);
   }
   showKey.apply(obj, ["arg1", "arg2"]); // "value arg1 arg2"
   ```

In summary, `bind()` is used to create a new function with a specific `this` value, while `call()` and `apply()` are used to invoke functions with a specific `this` value and arguments. The difference between `call()` and `apply()` is in how the arguments are passed: individually for `call()` and as an array for `apply()`.

### Q: How can you define a method inside an object?

**A:** You can define a method inside an object using either the object literal syntax or the `Object.defineProperty()` method.

1. **Using Object Literal Syntax:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = {
     key: "value",
     showKey() {
       console.log(this.key);
     },
   };

   obj.showKey(); // "value"
   ```

2. **Using `Object.defineProperty()`:**

   ```javascript
   const obj = { key: "value" };
   Object.defineProperty(obj, "showKey", {
     value: function () {
       console.log(this.key);
     },
     writable: true,
     enumerable: true,
     configurable: true,
   });

   obj.showKey(); // "value"
   ```

In both examples, the `showKey` method is defined inside the `obj` object and can be called to access the object's properties using the `this` keyword.

### Q: What happens if you return an object from a constructor function?

**A:** If you return an object from a constructor function, that object will be returned instead of the newly created instance. This allows you to override the default behavior of the constructor function.

Example:

```javascript
function MyConstructor() {
  this.key = "value";
  return { key: "new value" };
}

const instance = new MyConstructor();
console.log(instance.key); // "new value"
```

In this example, the constructor function returns a new object with `key: "new value"`. As a result, the `instance` variable holds this returned object instead of the default instance created by the constructor function. If you return a non-object value (e.g., a primitive), it will be ignored, and the newly created instance will be returned.

Example:

```javascript
function MyConstructor() {
  this.key = "value";
  return "ignored value";
}

const instance = new MyConstructor();
console.log(instance.key); // "value"
```

In this example, the constructor function returns a string, which is ignored. The `instance` variable holds the newly created instance with `key: "value"`.

### Q: How do arrow functions handle the `this` keyword differently than regular functions?

**A:** Arrow functions handle the `this` keyword differently than regular functions in that they do not have their own `this` context. Instead, they lexically inherit `this` from the surrounding scope at the time they are defined.

Example:

```javascript
const obj = {
  key: "value",
  regularFunction: function () {
    console.log(this.key); // "value"
  },
  arrowFunction: () => {
    console.log(this.key); // undefined
  },
};

obj.regularFunction(); // "value"
obj.arrowFunction(); // undefined
```

In this example, `regularFunction` has its own `this` context, which refers to the `obj` object. However, `arrowFunction` inherits `this` from the surrounding scope, which is the global scope in this case, resulting in `undefined`.

Arrow functions are useful when you want to preserve the `this` context from the surrounding scope, such as in callbacks or event handlers.

Example:

```javascript
function Timer() {
  this.seconds = 0;
  setInterval(() => {
    this.seconds++;
    console.log(this.seconds);
  }, 1000);
}

const timer = new Timer();
// Logs the incrementing seconds value every second
```

In this example, the arrow function inside `setInterval` inherits `this` from the `Timer` constructor function, allowing it to correctly reference `this.seconds`.
